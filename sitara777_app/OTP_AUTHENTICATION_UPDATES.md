# OTP Authentication Updates

## Overview
Your Flutter app already had OTP-based authentication implemented with MSG91 service. I've enhanced the existing login and register screens to provide a better user experience and more robust OTP verification flow.

## Changes Made

### 1. Login Screen (`lib/screens/auth/login_screen.dart`)
**Enhanced Features:**
- ✅ **Streamlined OTP Flow**: Phone number → Send OTP → Verify OTP → Login
- ✅ **Better Input Validation**: 10-digit mobile number validation
- ✅ **Enhanced Error Handling**: More descriptive error messages
- ✅ **Timer Management**: 60-second countdown for OTP resend
- ✅ **Loading States**: Visual feedback during API calls
- ✅ **Auto-verification**: OTP auto-verification when 6 digits are entered

**Key Features:**
- Phone number input with validation
- OTP verification using PIN code fields
- Resend OTP functionality with countdown timer
- Integration with MSG91 service
- Automatic navigation to main screen on successful login

### 2. Register Screen (`lib/screens/auth/register_screen.dart`)
**Enhanced Features:**
- ✅ **Complete Registration Flow**: Name → Phone → Password → OTP → Register
- ✅ **OTP Verification**: Phone number verification before account creation
- ✅ **Retry Logic**: Enhanced OTP retry functionality using request IDs
- ✅ **Form Validation**: Comprehensive validation for all fields
- ✅ **User Experience**: Change phone number option during OTP verification
- ✅ **Password Security**: Toggle visibility for password field

**Key Features:**
- Name, phone, and password input
- OTP verification before registration completion
- Smart retry using MSG91's retry API when request ID is available
- Fallback to new OTP if retry fails
- Profile update and authentication on successful verification

### 3. MSG91 Service Integration
**Already Implemented:**
- ✅ **Multiple API Endpoints**: Primary and fallback OTP services
- ✅ **Retry Functionality**: Smart retry using request IDs
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with timeouts
- ✅ **Cache Management**: Request ID caching for retry functionality

## Technical Implementation

### OTP Flow
1. **Send OTP**: User enters phone number → API call to MSG91 → OTP sent via SMS
2. **Verify OTP**: User enters 6-digit OTP → Verification API call → Success/Error response
3. **Retry Logic**: Uses request ID for smart retry, fallback to new OTP if needed
4. **Authentication**: Updates auth provider and navigates to main screen

### Security Features
- Phone number validation (10-digit Indian numbers)
- OTP timeout management (60-second intervals)
- Secure API integration with MSG91
- Input sanitization and validation

### User Experience
- Clear visual feedback for all states (loading, success, error)
- Intuitive PIN code input for OTP
- Countdown timer for resend functionality
- Option to change phone number during verification
- Automatic form progression
